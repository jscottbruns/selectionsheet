<h2>Construction Scheduling - Superintendent</h2>
	While much of our competition gears their products toward the builder, we began by focusing on the needs of the superintendent in the field. By starting with starting in the field, we’re able to focus on every detail of the job, from the beginning. From digging the foundation, to framing, to drywall, to walkthrough, we approach every step as its own and allow you to consolidate your build time through an extraordinarily easy approach. 
	<br />
	One of the common complaints among many superintendents we’ve encountered is the growing frustration of their builder requiring their superintendents to use a different computerized tool every year. The builder decides they’ve outgrown that product, they move on to the next. Superintendents that use SelectionSheet often do so not because their builder forces them to, but because it makes their job easier and more organized. End result: Less mistakes, customization and documentation of the entire building process resulting in a shorter build time!

	<h3>Running Schedules</h3>
	Our approach to daily management of your production lots is simple. Every aspect of the running schedule is customizable to your preferences. View your schedule by day, by week, by 2 weeks or by month. Each schedule is separated by lot, allowing you to manage an unlimited number of lots in all levels of production. Lots within different communities are broken down by community, allowing you to locate what you need quickly. 
	<br />
	Each task within your lot is fully independent of other tasks and is displayed by color according to its status, the colors customizable to your preferences. Having the ability to control each task independently of others prevents you from performing other tasks that may be independent of the first. For example, a failed inspection might put a stop to production on a certain lot, pushing the finish date back an extra week. Our approach to the critical path will allow other tasks, independent of that failed inspection to continue, keeping you on schedule for that finish date. 
	<br />
	For an industry professional, much of this is common sense. Common sense or not, a lot happens during construction, even more so when you’re trying to balance 8 different lots in all different stages of production. Our running schedule eliminates the head ache and organizes your daily construction management needs.

	<h3>Subcontractors</h3>
	Like it or not, your finish date is often controlled by the reliability of your subs. No aspect of project management will prevent every subcontractor mistake, but having the ability to tie each subcontractor into their respective task inside your running schedule will help you to make sure they’re there in plenty of time! 
	<br />
	One of the common complaints amongst superintendents is their need for better subcontractor communications. You call your plumbing sub to make sure they’re confirmed for tomorrow, you get their answering machine. You call you’re drywall sub to find out why they haven’t show up to yet, and while you’re on the phone with them, you’re plumbing sub calls back and gets your voicemail. It’s a common problem, only exaserbated the more ongoing production you have going on. 
	<br />
	Here’s our solution. You’re in your running schedule, you click on your task ‘Plumbing Rough’, in less than a second every detail about that sub appears in front of you. From their address, to their many phone numbers to their email address. Now, instead of struggling to find that subs number in your phone, it is concisely organized by the task they’re responsible for. And to add to the convenience, you can eliminated the phone call all together by sending a reminder, a fax or an email all from within your running schedule!

<div style="display:none ">
	<h3>Customizable Tasks</h3>
	We understand that no one house is the same. Whether you build single family houses, townhouses, parking garages or strip malls, we offer a method of customizing and organizing your tasks that is so simple we’ll do it for you! 
	<br />
	We organize each project into a “task template.” This allows you to keep your different construction project types organized and separate from others. For example, superintendents with smaller builders may be responsible for production of both single family’s and townhouses within the same community. While the tasks associated with each project might not be entirely different, each project is unique. 
	<br />
	Through our short, multi-step process, we’ll walk you through creating a new task template, defining the critical path and laying it out for production. Each task can be customized to meet the specific needs of that project, and can be entirely independent of tasks in other task templates or projects. 
	<br />
	Go from scratch to production in 30 minutes, and have the ability to share your task templates with other users throughout the SelectionSheet community. Once you’ve created a new task template, you can continue to make changes and customizations over time. Add new tasks, tighten up your critical path, create reminders for yourself. The possibilities are limitless!
	<br />
	We’ve designed our system to act as a stand-alone product for you, the superintendent. This allows to retain your customized projects, your subcontractors and every other aspect of SelectionSheet if you were to change builders. While you probably won’t have a need for details about a specific lot you were working on, if you move on to another builder, you can avoid the hastle of having to start the process again by bringing SelectionSheet with you!

	<h3>Construction Scheduling for your BlackBerry</h3>
	While some superintendents aren’t quite as lucky as others to get a trailer with an internet connection, we’ve developed a solution for you! Regardless of having a computer in the field or not SelectionSheet Blackberry allows you to take your running schedules, subcontractors and the like with you as you move from lot to lot. The software is free and after a quick download to your blackberry you can make the same schedule changes as you could from your computer. 
	<br />
	Make notes to tasks as you check up on your subs, mark your inspections as passed, failed, etc, after chatting with the inspector. The flexibility of being able to take your schedule with you into the field only increases your ability to have more control over your building projects. Avoid having to find the many post-it notes you scribbled on once you get back to the office. Make your changes on your blackberry, in real time, and they’ll be waiting for you at the click of a button!
