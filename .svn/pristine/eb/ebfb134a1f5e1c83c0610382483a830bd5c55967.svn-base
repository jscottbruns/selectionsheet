<h1>Name</h1>
<p>packer->allocate -- remove a rectangular region from the free space map</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>int <b>packer->allocate</b> ( object field area )</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This function takes the area defined by the single parameter and subtracts
it from the current free space map. The function never fails, if the space isn't
available, no changes are made to the free space map.</p>
<p><code>area</code> must be a <code>field</code> object.</p>
<p>Allocate currently only has one policy it applies to fragmentation: "prefer
vertical fragment".  This may change in the future. After fragmentation, the
free space map is examined and fragments that have a common border are joined
into a single fragment.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>See <code>example-packer.php</code> in the examples directory.</p>
<h1>See Also</h1>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>Added with the packer in 2.6</p>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<p>"prefer vertical fragment" is pretty limited. At the least there should also
be "prefer horizontal fragment" available.  Even more fragmentation policies
are available, and may be necessary to build any real intelligence into the
packer.</p>
