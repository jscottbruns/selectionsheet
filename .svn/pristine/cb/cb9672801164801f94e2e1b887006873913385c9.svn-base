<h1>Name</h1>
<p>jfif_embed -- embed a jfif (jpeg) image into the PDF</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>int <b>jfif_embed</b> ( string data )</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This function is used to insert an external JFIF file into the PDF
file. (JFIF files are commonly called jpeg files, this is not entirely
accurate, however)</p>
<p>The single parameter <code>data</code> should contain the raw,
binary JFIF data. The function returns a library ID that must be used
to paint the embedded image, or false on error.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Assuming that <code>image.jpg</code> is a valid JFIF file, the
following code will extract the file data, embed it into the PDF
file, and paint it to a page.</p>
<pre>
$page = $pdf->new_page("letter");
$fh = fopen("image.jpg", "r");
$filedata = fread($fh, filesize("image.jpg"));
fclose($fh);
$image = $pdf->jfif_embed($filedata);
$placement = $pdf->image_place($image, 10, 10, $page);
</pre>
<h1>See Also</h1>
<p>This function is really only a convenience wrapper around
<code><a href='function.image_raw_embed.html'>->image_raw_embed()</a></code>
that extracts the necessary data for embedding the image from the jfif
stream itself.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<p>Some PDF viewers have problems displaying images in
certain formats. Before reporting bugs concerning images, ensure that
you are using the latest version of your PDF viewer program.  Also
be sure that the image is not created with unusual jfif options (try
creating it with all special optimizations turned off).</p>
