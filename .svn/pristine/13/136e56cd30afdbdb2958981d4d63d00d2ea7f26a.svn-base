	<h2>Build Your Own House with SelectionSheet.com!</h2>
	We think that our system is so easy to use that we’ve developed a method for everyone, even you as a homeowner! Take advantage of a process, developed specifically for you as a homeowner to act as your own builder. You’ll save tens of thousands and have the satisfaction of doing it yourself!
	<br />
	While many, if not all aspects of building a house can be unfamiliar, we’ll create a custom template according to your specifications, mapping out each and every task involved in building the home of your dreams. You provide us with your blue prints and we’ll have one of our experienced superintendents take those prints and turn them into a step by step process outlined over a calendar. 
</div>
<div style="display:none ">
	<h3>Outlined tasks define each step</h3>
	While the majority, if not all aspects of building a home can be complicated, by following your custom template, which has been designed specifically for you, according to your plans, each and every step involved in the entire building process is outlined for you to follow. We take your drawings and turn them into an easy to follow step by step process. By following the tasks outlined in your template, you’ll have an accurate depiction of when your house will be complete, and be prepared for each new step weeks in advance. 
	<br />
	Preparation is key. When we create your task template from your prints, you’ll be prepared for each significant and not so significant step. There’s nothing more frustrating for a do-it-yourself homeowner to have to turn away one of your contractors because you forgot to order materials. Or your HVAC contractor tells you they can’t start their work because you inadvertently forgot to schedule your framing inspection. Each step within your construction process contains various reminders, letting you know weeks in advance, ‘now is the time to order your framing materials.’ Don’t worry about not know when your framing inspection should take place, if you can follow the steps in your production template, you’re inspection will occur on time. 
</div>
<div style="display:none ">
	<h3>Schedule your subcontractors</h3>
	We all know that having the ambition of building your own home is easier said than done. Without having the contractors to do the work, you won’t get very far. Our approach to organizing your contractors is as simple as clicking on a task in your production template. The ability to link each task to your contractor helps to keep this process simple and organized. We’ll help you tag each task to a contractor, giving you the convenience of a simple click when it’s time to schedule that trade. Within that click, you’ll have their contact information at your finger tips and have the ability to send them an email or fax from within your running schedule. 
	<br />
	Our growing database of subcontractors nationwide makes your search easy! While many homeowners already have their preference as to which contractors they prefer to use, we’ll give you the variety and flexibility to schedule your contractors without the hassle of spending hours on the phone.
</div>
<div style="display:none ">
	<h3>We’ll be with you every step of the way!</h3>
	We know how important your new home is to you. That’s why we’ll commit everything we can to help make your success. We’ve geared our system not to the building industry, but to you, someone who may have little to zero knowledge in the construction industry. We’ll always be a phone call away, ready to answer any questions you may have along the way. We have experienced superintendents on staff to help ensure your success and while we’re not your builder, we’ll help to deliver the satisfaction of building your dream home!
	<br />
	One of our goals here at SelectionSheet was not only to build the perfect scheduling and project management system, but to build a community. We pride ourselves in building and maintaining strong and growing relationships with out customers. Through our discussion boards everyone in the SelectionSheet community has at their fingertips, the resources unavailable elsewhere.
