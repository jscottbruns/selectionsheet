<h1>Name</h1>
<p>draw_one_paragraph -- Paint a paragraph of text to a page</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>mixed <b>draw_one_paragraph</b> ( int top, int left, int bottom, int right, string text, int pageid[, array parameters] )</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This function paints a string of text on a page specified by
<code>pageid</code> bounded by the rectangle specified by
<code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and
<code>right</code>.  The optional array <code>parameters</code> can
be used to override the default text settings when placing the text.</p>
<p>See the documentation on the <code><a href='function.draw_text.html'>draw_text</a>()</code>
function for details on default settings and the use of the
<a href='data.parameters.html'>parameters array</a>.</p>
<p>Text is wrapped as needed to keep it within the boundries of the defined
box.</p>
<p>If the text string is too large to place in the alloted space,
the text that could not be placed is returned. If the entire space is
not filled, the value of <code>bottom</code> that would have been
exactly filled is returned.</p>
<p>This function does not take into account newlines, and newlines should
not be included in <code>text</code>. If you need to place multiple paragraphs
seperated by newlines, either use <a href='function.draw_paragraph.html'>
draw_paragraph</a>() or split the text into individual paragraphs before
using the function (as in the below example).</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Assuming that $content is a large amount of text, the following
lines will turn it into a PDF file, using as many pages as needed:</p>
<pre>
$pdf = new pdffile;
$p = explode("\n", $content);
$top =720;
$page = $pdf->new_page("letter");
foreach ($p as $one) {
    while (is_string($one)) {
        $one = $pdf->draw_one_paragraph($top, 72, 72, 540, $one, $page);
        if (is_string($one)) {
            $page = $pdf->new_page("letter");
            $top = 720;
        } else {
            $top = $one;
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>This function first appeared in version 1.14.</p>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<p>Lines are wrapped at word boundries. If a single word is longer than
the alloted space, it is placed on a line by itself.</p>
<p>The behaviour of a text string with a newline is undefined.</p>
