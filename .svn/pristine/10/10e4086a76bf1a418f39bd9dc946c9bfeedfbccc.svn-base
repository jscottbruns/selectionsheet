<h1>Name</h1>
<p>Introduction to extensions</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Extensions are part of the phppdflib that are probably not used by
everyone. They are thus implemented in an "on demand" way that prevents
them from tying up memory when not used.</p>
<p>The technical explanation is: They are stored in a seperate class
file that included only when enabled.</p>
<p>From the user's standpoint, the extension is enabled by a
<code>$pdf->enable('extensionname')</code> call, and its methods are
accessed with calls like <code>$pdf->extensionname->methodname()</code>
or <code>$pdf->x['extensionname']->methodname()</code>.</p>
<h2>Writing extensions</h2>
<p>Writing extensions is relatively straightforward. The basic steps
are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the <code>examples/extension.class.php</code> extension template
    to the name you want your extension to have. Put it in the same
    directory as <code>phppdflib.class.php</code>.
<li>Edit the class name to match the filename.
<li>Add the functionality you need to the class.
</ol>
<p>There are very few requirements phppdflib makes of an extension,
they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extension must a class.
<li>The class name must match the filename.
<li>Extension names are in lowercase.
<li>The extension must contain a class variable named <code>$pdf</code>.
    This variable will be a reference back to the main phppdflib object,
    and can (and should) be used by the extension to access the methods
    of phppdflib.
<li>Extensions fall under the terms of GPL, and must be published under
    the GPL license.
</ul>
<p>The following recommendations apply to extensions, but are not
requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>To maintain compatibility going forward, extensions should only
    access the public methods of phppdflib. They should not access
    class variables or private methods.
<li>Methods in your extension intended to be private should be
    prefixed with an underscore.
</ul>
