What is HTML_ToPDF?
-------------------

HTML_ToPDF is a PHP class that makes it easy to convert HTML documents to PDF
files on the fly.  HTML_ToPDF grew out of the need to convert HTML files (which
are easy to create) to PDF files (which are not so easy to create) fast and
easily.  It has the following features: 

* The ability to convert images in the webpage to images embedded in the PDF.
  The script tries to convert relative image paths in to absolute ones as well.

* The ability to use the CSS in the HTML file in the creation of the PDF.  This
  includes remote CSS files as well.

* The ability to convert remote files

* The ability to convert links into embedded clickable links in the PDF file.

* The ability to scale the HTML page.

* Easy setting of any of these options through the methods of the class.

* Tries to fix quirks in html pages which break html2ps.

* PEAR error handling.

* Works on both Unix/Linux and Windows.

What is PDFEncryptor?
---------------------

PDFEncryptor is a helper class that comes with this package.  It is also a
wrapper for a couple of free java libraries that allow you to digitally sign
and protect the PDFs you create by adding a password, permissions (such as
printing and copying rights), and meta-data such as the Keywords and Author.

Obtaining HTML_ToPDF 
--------------------

Further information on HTML_ToPDF and the latest version can be obtained at

Installation
------------

There is no real installation other than requiring the file.  See the
examples directory for help in how to use the class.  However, you do need to
make sure that whatever directory the PDF files are going to be created in is
writable by the user the webserver runs as.  Also note you need to install the
programs below.

Requirements
------------

* PHP: Version 4.0.4 or greater (http://www.php.net). 

* html2ps: Does the initial conversion of html to a postscript file, and
  thus is the most crucial part of the conversion.  More information
  about it is here: http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html You will
  especially want to read the user's guide here:
  http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2psug.html if this script is not making
  the pdf look like you want.

* ps2pdf: This comes with the Ghostscript package, and can be found
  here: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ This package is normally
  installed as an RPM on RedHat systems, so if you're using that OS you
  shouldn't have to worry.  There is a windows install for this as well.

* curl: Or some program that grabs documents off the web (lynx, w3m,
  etc.).  HOWEVER, for whatever reason only curl has worked in my tests
  when the script page is running as a web script and not just a script
  from the command line.  Curl can be found here: http://curl.haxx.se/

* PEAR: The default installation of PEAR is needed for the error
  handling and OS checking.  PEAR comes with the default installation of 
  PHP 4 so you should normally not have to worry.  Installation instructions 
  can be found here: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php

* Valid HTML: Good HTML (XHTML is best) definitely helps.

* PDFEncryptor needs java (http://java.sun.com) and the iText jar file 
  (http://itext.sourceforge.net/downloads/)

Common Problems
---------------

* How do I make this stupid thing work under windows?!
It took me many headaches to figure out, but here is what I came up with, YMMV:
    - Make sure you install the windows version of all the programs above
      (ghostscript, ImageMagick, curl, etc.)

    - html2ps requires a bit more work to get working than the other programs.
      Follow these steps to get it working:
        * Install ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com/)
        * Download html2ps from http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html
        * Extract all the files to c:\html2ps
        * Create a file named html2psrc in c:\html2ps with this in it:
        @html2ps {
          package {
            ImageMagick: 1;
          }
          hyphenation {
            en {
              file: "c:\html2ps\hyphen.tex";
            }
          }
        }
        * Open up the html2ps file in c:\html2ps folder with a decent text
          editor (i.e. VIM, not notepad!) and make the following changes:
          Change line 22 to:
          $globrc='c:\html2ps\html2psrc';
          Add this after line 497:
          $scr='c:\html2ps\scratch';

    - If you use IIS, make sure you give the IUSR_xxxx user read, write (this
      is important), and exec permissions to the cmd.exe program in the
      system32 folder in your Windows system directory.

    - Put the following in your script (modify the paths to fit your
      installation, though) after instantiating the $pdf variable:
        $pdf->setHtml2Ps('perl c:\html2ps\html2ps');
        $pdf->setPs2Pdf('c:\Program Files\gs\gs8.52\bin\gswin32c.exe');
        $pdf->setTmpDir('\temp');
        $pdf->setGetUrl('c:\PHP\curl.exe -i -s');

    - You won't get any error output, so if it's not working, run each command
      (you can see this by turning debugging on -- $pdf->setDebug(true) ) from
      the command prompt to find out the problem.

* No files are created.
    - Likely the problem is due to a lack of permissions.  Either the tmp
      directory that HTML_ToPDF uses for intermediary files is not writable by
      the webserver or the output directory for the PDF file is not writable by
      the webserver.  Possible fixes are:
      // Change the tmp directory
      $pdf->setTmpDir('/somewhere/writable');
      // Change the directory permissions
      bash# chmod 777 www/pdfs; chown apache www/pdfs

* It complains of not being able to include PEAR.php.
    - This is because HTML_ToPDF uses PEAR for error handling.  You can
      download PEAR from http://pear.php.net/  If you cannot get your hands on
      PEAR you can comment out all the places where an error is raised.

* The images don't show up.
    - Often the program getting the images (i.e. curl) is having a problem.
      These errors can usually be seen if the program is run from the command
      line.

* ps2pdf fails with error code 127
    - The problem is that the ps2pdf shell script does not have the path to the
      'gs' executable.  Look in the ps2pdf and see where it points to (usually
      it executes ps2pdf12 which in turn executes ps2pdfwr).  Once your in the
      file that actually does something, you will see this line at the bottom
      of the file:
      exec gs $OPTIONS...
      Change that to:
      exec /path/to/gs $OPTIONS...
