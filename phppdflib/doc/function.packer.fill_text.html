<h1>Name</h1>
<p>packer->fill_text -- fill provided text into remaining free space</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>mixed <b>packer->fill_text</b> ( string text[, float padding[, float minwidth]] )</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This function takes the text provided in <code>text</code> and places it on
the page, using whatever free space remains in the free space map, using the
current default text settings.</p>
<p><code>padding</code> specifies an amount away from the edge of each field
to hold the text. This prevents the text from running together when fields have
edges that touch. The value is in em (the width of the letter "M" in the current
font) and defaults to 1.</p>
<p><code>minwidth</code> is the minimum width fragment that should be used.
Fragments narrower than <code>minwidth</code> are not used to place text.
The calculation takes <code>padding</code> in to account, so the actual width
of the fragment must equal or exceed 2 * <code>padding</code> +
<code>minwidth</code>. The value is in em.</p>
<p>The function returns <code>true</code> if all text was placed. If the text
could not be fit in the available free space, the text that was not placed is
returned.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>See <code>example-packer.php</code> in the examples directory.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>Added with the packer in 2.6</p>
<h1>Bugs</h1>
<p>This should create new pages as needed, but the logic to do so without
"shooting the programmer in the foot" has not occured to me yet.</p>
<p>The layout policy is "closest fragment to upper-left corner". Aside from
being non-i18n, this policy probably won't always flow text in the way the
user would like.</p>
