<h1>Name</h1>
<p>Introduction to the packer</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The packer extension is intended to be a major leap forward in the
technology of generating PDFs. The eventual goal is that you'll just feed all
your data to the packer, and it will figure out how to fit it on the page
(or create new pages as needed).</p>
<p>The packer is a long way from achieving that goal, but it does have some
useful things it can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will keep track of unused regions (called fields) on a page.
<li>It will fill text into those regions.
</ul>
<p>Ok, ok, it's not much, but it's a start. Here's how to use the packer as it
currently stands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the packer extension:<br>
    <code>$pdf->enable('packer');</code>
<li>Use the packer's method to create new pages:<br>
    <code>$page = $pdf->packer->new_page();</code>
<li>Place fixed-sized elements on the page:<br>
    <code>$pdf->draw_rectangle(50, 10, 10, 50, $page);</code>
<li>Make sure the packer knows that space is no longer available for use.<br>
    <code>$space = new field(10, 50, 10, 50);<br>
    $pdf->packer->allocate($space);</code>
<li>Ask the packer to fill your text in around other objects:<br>
    <code>$pdf->packer->fill_text($text);</code>
<li>Repeat for additional pages.
</ol>
<p>At the time of writing, the packer seems to be working in the sense that I've
yet to see it do anything insane, or crash. That doesn't mean it's going to
produce useful results. As detailed below in the "rational", there are areas
of potential failure that I still have not addressed. </p>
<h2>Rational</h2>
<p>The concept of the packer engine started with perl's Tk library, and the
packer included.
phppdflib's packer will run somewhat differently, since the main restraining
factor is available page space and phppdflib can create new pages at will - two
things the perl packer doesn't factor in to its reasoning.</p>
<p>The basic idea I have is that each page will store an array of rectangles
that indicate the unused space on the page. Initially, a page will consist of a
single rectangle (bounded by the page margins)  All painting functions will
remove the space they use from this pool, thus keeping track of how much space
is still available to use on the page. Special functions will allow a client
script to paint an object "in the next available space", and the packer should
create new pages as needed to place objects.</p>
<p>Inside the machine, the painting of an object will take the rectangle that
it's placed in and break it into sub-rectangles that identify remaining space.
To illistrate, a page initially consists of a single "field" (that's the term
I'm going to coin, we'll see if it sticks):<br>
<pre>
+----------+
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
+----------+
</pre>
When we place (for example) an image on the page, it allocates some space (a)
and the remaining space is broken into new rectangles (b & c)<br>
<pre>
+----+-----+
|    |  a  |
|    |     |
| b  +-----+
|    |     |
|    |  c  |
|    |     |
+----+-----+
</pre>
The allotment of remaining space is not arbitrary, it attempts to keep the
largest vertical area possible (b) since that's how text normally flows. A
special function will exist to "fill in" text in the remaining space - the
idea being that a user can place all her/his images in the document, and then
automagically have the packer flow the text around the images.</p>
<p>Since this section was originally written, I believe I've solved some of the
problems that orinally worried me. I feel that the code I currently have in
place can handle any possible allocation of space from a collection of fields
of arbitrary complexity. However, this has introduced new concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the fragmentation of free regions is unideal. Perhaps the packer
    should support different allocation polocies that fragment differently
    (vertical vs. horizontal?)  Possibly functions so that a client script could
    request restructuring of the fields under a different policy?
<li>So far it seems apparent that attempts should be made to consolodate small
    fields into larger ones after each allocation (this realization came about
    through early testing). The easiest scenerio to handle is already handled,
    and that is joining fields that have a common border (see ->merge() in the
    source). Other (more complicated) scenerios will probably need addressed.
<li>There's probably some threshold at which a field is too small to be useful.
    Unfortunately, that threshold is probably different for each different type
    of object. Text, for example, has a more aggresive horizontal threshold
    than vertical, while images may not have any practical threshold that
    should be set.
<li>Some sort of function to tile images throughout the remaining space might
    be useful
<li>I call the current fragmenting policy "prefer vertical".  Others are
    possible, and quite likely necessary. Here's what I can think of
    right now:
    <ul>
    <li>Prefer vertical: See above
    <li>Prefer horizontal: Obvious variant
    <li>Prefer largest area: Arrange fragments so each one uses the largest
        space possible
    <li>Prefer common border: creates many small fragments, so all shared
        borders are exactly shared.
    </ul>
    Possibly, by creating a free space map object, these different policies
    could all be available and dynamically generated as needed. Hmmm ...
</ul>
