<h1>Advanced debugging</h1>
<p>I highly recommend the book <u>The Art of Unix Programming</u> by Eric
Raymond.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, I realized that phppdflib was probably
too difficult to hack on. In order for someone to help write code, they
would have to overcome three major learning obsticles. They would have to
have a good understanding of PHP, a good understanding of PDF, and an
understanding of how phppdflib works. I would think that the average person
who wants to get involved either already understands PHP or PDF, and there
is excellent documentation on both if not, so I'm going to focus on
getting over the final hurdle: understanding how this library works
internally.</p>
<p>There is very little documentation on the internals, and the source code
is sparsely documented. Until now, I've felt the code was obvious in its
function, and Raymond's book made me realize why. I believe the most difficult
to grasp concept is the structuring of data within the library. Since PHP's
arrays are actually hashes, and they can be built dynamically without any
preconception of their structures, there is precious little documentation
within the code on what these structures are and how they're used. Thus,
someone reading the code for the first time sees a number of symbols being
juggled around that have no real meaning to him.</p>
<p>My first attempt to solve this issue is to create a debug variable for the
library that can be set to capture details of what's occurring during a run.</p>
<p>You will need PHP 4.3 or later to use this feature. All other portions of
phppdflib require PHP 4.0.6 or later.</p>
<p>To use it, set <code>$pdf->debug</code> to at least 10, then create your
PDF as you normally would. The class variable <code>$pdf->dbs</code> then
contains a large string value detailing the array structures that were
created for each object painted to the PDF. At first glance, it may seem that
simply using <code>print_r()</code> to view the <code>$pdf->objects</code>
variable would be just as easy, but the debug method adds some additional
chatter to help understand what's going on.</p>
<p>Additionally, setting <code>$pdf->debug</code> to at least 20 causes details
of the <code>->generate()</code> process to be stored in <code>$pdf->dbs</code>
as well. This has additional use in understanding the library, as well as being
helpful to someone who is trying to learn PDF for the first time.</p>
<p>There is more that should be done with this.  Additional debug levels should
be defined and additional debug traps peppered throughout the code to capture
activity as it occurs. This would help a new hacker understand both the
structure of data and the flow of program logic within the class.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will generate more interest in the library, and incite
development assistance.</p>
